This is my first attempt at MERN stack development and I made this while watching video on FreeCodeCamp

Although I have done a few small apps on ReactJS before, I have used MongoDB the first time
If you are downloading this project then make sure to create your own Cluster on MongoDB as it is free and change the link to the cluster in the Environment variables. This can be done inside the .env file. Copy the link you will get to connect nodejs to your cluster and make sure to add your IP address and update it every time you want to connect to te database.

Here is a GIF to show you how the web-app looks like:
